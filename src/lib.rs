//! # fastblur
//!
//! Fast (linear time) implementation of the Gaussian Blur algorithm in Rust.
//! Original taken from http://blog.ivank.net/fastest-gaussian-blur.html
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The image is assumed to be an RGB image with three channels.
//! This should change in the future, so you can blur as many channels as you want. Still very WIP.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[dependencies]
//! fastblur = { git = "https://github.com/fschutt/fastblur" }
//! ```
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use fastblur::gaussian_blur;
//!
//! // data is a Vec<[u8;3]> - 3 items for R, G and B.
//! // This format will probably change.
//! gaussian_blur(&mut data, width, height, 10.0);
//! ```
